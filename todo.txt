Okay, I understand. You want to implement the "Gestion des affectations" (Assignment Management) functionality on the "Projets & Missions" page (templates/projets.html). This involves selecting professionals as either "associés" or "contributeurs" for a project using checkboxes and saving these assignments to the database.

This is a new feature that builds upon the concepts we used for managing attendees in RCP meetings. We'll need to modify both the frontend and the backend.

Here's the plan:

Examine Frontend Files:
Read templates/projets.html to understand the page structure and identify where to add the assignment interface within the project details section.
Identify the relevant JavaScript file(s) for this page (likely js/projetsManager.js).
Examine Backend Files:
Read api/projets/index.js to understand the existing API routes for projects.
Read models/Projet.js to understand the project data model.
Read models/Professionnel.js (which we already have) to confirm the professional model structure.
Design Database Schema: Determine how to model the relationship between Projet and Professionnel for both "associés" and "contributeurs". This will likely require one or two new join tables.
Modify Backend API:
Update the GET route for a single project (/api/projets/:id) to include the associated "associés" and "contributeurs".
Update the POST (create) and PUT (update) routes for projects to accept arrays of IDs for "associés" and "contributeurs" and use Sequelize association methods.
Update DataService.js: Add/modify functions in DataService.js to fetch project data including associated professionals and to send the updated assignment data to the backend.
Implement Frontend Logic: Add HTML elements for assignment selection in templates/projets.html and JavaScript logic (likely in js/projetsManager.js) to populate and handle the checkboxes, similar to the RCP meeting attendees.
Database Migration: Create and run the necessary Sequelize migration(s) to add the new join table(s) to the database.
Let's start by examining the frontend file templates/projets.html.
