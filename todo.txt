Okay, I can explain the changes needed in config/database.js to switch from SQLite to MySQL without actually modifying the file.

Your current config/database.js likely looks something like this, configuring Sequelize to use SQLite:

// config/database.js
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: 'sqlite', // Specifies the database dialect
  storage: './database/database.sqlite', // Path to your SQLite database file
  logging: false, // Optional: set to true to see SQL queries
});

module.exports = sequelize;
To migrate to MySQL, you will need to change the dialect and provide connection details specific to your MySQL server. You should also install the mysql2 package, which is a recommended driver for Sequelize with MySQL.

Here's how the relevant part of config/database.js will be changed:

Change the dialect: The dialect property will be changed from 'sqlite' to 'mysql'.
Replace storage with MySQL connection parameters: The storage property, which is specific to SQLite, will be removed. It will be replaced with host, port, database, username, and password properties.
Use Environment Variables for Credentials: For security, the username and especially the password should be loaded from environment variables (e.g., using a .env file and a package like dotenv).
After these changes, the config/database.js file will look something like this:

// config/database.js
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');
// Assuming you are using dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file
// require('dotenv').config(); // Uncomment if you use dotenv

const sequelize = new Sequelize(
  process.env.DB_DATABASE || 'aci_pur_db', // Your MySQL database name
  process.env.DB_USERNAME || 'root',     // Your MySQL username
  process.env.DB_PASSWORD || null,       // Your MySQL password (use environment variable!)
  {
    host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost', // Your MySQL host
    port: process.env.DB_PORT || 3306,       // Your MySQL port (default is 3306)
    dialect: 'mysql', // Specifies the database dialect
    logging: false, // Optional: set to true to see SQL queries
    // Other options like pool, dialectOptions can be added here
  }
);

module.exports = sequelize;
Summary of Changes:

The dialect property changes from 'sqlite' to 'mysql'.
The storage property is removed.
New properties host, port, database, username, and password are added with your MySQL connection details.
It's crucial to use process.env.YOUR_ENV_VAR to load sensitive information like the password from environment variables instead of hardcoding them.
This explains the core changes needed in the configuration file. The next steps in the plan involve exporting/importing the schema and data, which are command-line operations.
